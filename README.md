# ChatterPipe-rs
ChatterPipe is a CLI tool that lets you interact with powerful language models like GPT-4 to summarize text files. Just provide a text file as input and let ChatterPipe do its magic!

## Installation
Install ChatterPipe using cargo:
`cargo install chatterpipe`

## Setup/Configuration
Before using ChatterPipe for the first time (or at any time of your choice), run the setup command to configure your custom parent prompt.
The default prompt is as follows: 
```
Summarise the following in 300 tokens or less. Give your best attempt
```

## Usage
Run ChatterPipe with the following command:
```ctp <text_file_path> [--engine <engine>] [--raw]```
Where:
- <text_file_path> is the path to the text file you want to summarize.
- <engine> is an optional parameter specifying the language model to use (default is "gpt-4"). Available options are:
- "g4" for GPT-4
- "g4-32" for GPT-4-32k
- "g3" for GPT-3.5-turbo
- `--raw` is an optional flag to print the raw API response. Useful for debugging.

### Example
```
ctp myfile.txt --engine g4
```

### *Important:* Make sure to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable before running ChatterPipe. 
For example:
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key_here>
```
